                   <h3>BROWN THE DIAMOND JEWELLER</h3>
                   <p>The Browns story began in 1934 when Grandpa Jack opened a boutique jewellery store in downtown Johannesburg. 
                       He was a talented and highly skilled goldsmith having been taught by his own grandfather.
                    Larry Brown is the current custodian of Browns, who continues to uphold Grandpa Jackâ€™s legacy as a third generation jewellery designer.
                       Inspired by the first piece of jewellery our founder, Grandpa Jack, made for his wife, Granny Kate, in 193
                   </p>

                    <P>Our signature designs include our Angel motif, symbolising love, guidance and protection. Although imitated by jewellers across the world, 
                        this design remains registered and exclusive to Browns.</p>
