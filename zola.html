                   <h3>ZOLA</h3>
                   <p> PG-R || 1 hr 26 min || Comedy, Drama </p>
                    <p>Taylour Paige (Zola), Riley Keough (Stefani), Nicholas Braun (Derrek), Colman Domingo (X)</p>

                    <p>From acclaimed writer/director Janicza Bravo, Zola's stranger than fiction saga, which she first told in a now iconic series of viral, 
                        uproarious tweets, comes to dazzling cinematic life. Zola (Taylour Paige), a Detroit waitress, strikes up a new friendship with a customer, 
                        Stefani (Riley Keough), who seduces her to join a weekend of dancing and partying in Florida.
                        What at first seems like a glamorous trip full of “hoeism” rapidly transforms into a 48-hour journey involving a nameless pimp, an idiot boyfriend, 
                        some Tampa gangsters and other unexpected adventures in this wild, see-it-to-believe-it tale.</p>
